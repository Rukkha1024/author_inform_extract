      "abstract": "In the United States, the number of fall-related injuries (15) requiring medical care and, possibly, fall-related deaths of older adults seems to be increasing. Exercise robustly and significantly decreases not only the rate of falls and fall risk by up to 30% compared with control groups but also fall-related fractures (13). Notably, the results of a systematic review and meta-analysis indicate that participation by older adults in exercise programs reduces the incidence of fall-related serious injuries (12). However, only a fraction of adults older than 65 yr actually engage in regular exercise (17) and, therefore, derive this benefit. Even if the participation rate in exercise programs by older adults was doubled, the current rate at which the size of the population of older adults is growing guarantees that the absolute number of falls will increase. This presents a related set of problems, the emergence of which can be predicted with …",

      "abstract": "Step-by-step variations in step width have been hypothesized to reflect adjustments to swing foot placement in response to preceding frontal plane trunk kinematics. The present study tested this hypothesis while 12 younger and 11 older subjects walked on treadmill for 10min at a self-selected velocity. The relationship between step-by-step variations in step width and frontal plane trunk COM kinematics was determined using multiple regression analysis. Trunk kinematics at midstance were significantly (p<0.001) and strongly (R2=0.54) related to the subsequent foot placement supporting the primary hypothesis. Additionally, this relationship was significantly affected by age (p<0.001) and stepping limb (p<0.001). These results implicate feedback driven control of foot trajectory during the swing phase. Further, they provide a biomechanical framework by which loss of frontal plane dynamic stability may result from a …",

However, the mechanisms underlying the increased risk are not clear. The risk factors for falls in people with OALE found in the literature are mostly the same as the risk factors for people without OALE. It is hypothesized that risk factors for falls are exacerbated by OALE, such that these individuals are more likely to become dynamically unstable and, once this has occurred, are less able to perform an appropriate compensatory stepping response compared with people without OALE. To the extent that this is true, task-specific training targeting the compensatory step, which decreases falls in middle-aged and older women, should be effective for people with OALE.

Participants completed baseline testing before the start of the season and again at return to play postconcussion. Injuries were tracked using an electronic medical database. Participants were instrumented with three APDM Opal triaxial accelerometers and performed five single-task (ST) and five dual-task (DT) gait trials. Participants traversed a 10-meter walkway, turned around a specified endpoint, and returned to the original line. During DT, participants simultaneously walked and answered mini-mental style questions. A linear mixed-effects model assessed interactions and/or main effects between groups for gait speed, double support time, cadence, stride length, and cognitive accuracy.ResultsThe LEMSK group walked slower (ST, 1.15±0.10 m· s; DT, 1.01±0.10 m· s) than the uninjured group (ST, 1.23±0.11 m· s; DT, 1.10±0.11 m· s) during both ST (P= 0.04) and DT (P= 0.03).

Over the course of six training sessions, five subjects responded to postural disturbances that necessitated forward compensatory steps to avoid falling. Subjects improved their ability to recover from these postural disturbances without falling or hopping on the non-prosthetic limb. Subjects improved their compensatory stepping response by decreasing trunk flexion and increasing the sagittal plane distance between the body center of mass and the stepping foot.

      "abstract": "Our main interest is to identify how humans maintain upright while walking. Balance during standing and walking is different, primarily due to a gait cycle which the nervous system must contend with a variety of body configurations and frequent perturbations (i.e., heel-strike). We have identified three mechanisms that healthy young adults use to respond to a visually perceived fall to the side. The lateral ankle mechanism and the foot placement mechanism are used to shift the center of pressure in the direction of the perceived fall, and the center of mass away from the perceived fall. The push-off mechanism, a systematic change in ankle plantarflexion angle in the trailing leg, results in fine adjustments to medial-lateral balance near the end of double stance. The focus here is to understand how the three basic balance mechanisms are coordinated to produce an overall balance response. The results indicate that lateral ankle and foot placement mechanisms are inversely related. Larger lateral ankle responses lead to smaller foot placement changes. Correlations involving the push-off mechanism, while significant, were weak. However, the consistency of the correlations across stimulus conditions suggest the push-off mechanism has the role of small adjustments to medial-lateral movement near the end of the balance response. This verifies that a fundamental feature of human bipedal gait is a highly flexible balance system that recruits and coordinates multiple mechanisms to maintain upright balance during walking to accommodate extreme changes in body configuration and frequent perturbations.",

      "year": 2019,
      "abstract": "We have previously identified three balance mechanisms that young healthy adults use to maintain balance while walking. The three mechanisms are: (1) The lateral ankle mechanism, an active modulation of ankle inversion/eversion in stance; (2) The foot placement mechanism, an active shift of the swing foot placement; and (3) The push-off mechanism, an active modulation of the ankle plantarflexion angle during double stance. Here we seek to determine whether there are changes in neural control of balance when walking at different cadences and speeds. Twenty-one healthy young adults walked on a self-paced treadmill while immersed in a 3D virtual reality cave, and periodically received balance perturbations (bipolar galvanic vestibular stimulation) eliciting a perceived fall to the side. Subjects were instructed to match two cadences specified by a metronome, 110 bpm (High) and 80 bpm (Low), which in this experiment, led to faster and slower gait speeds, respectively. The results indicate that subjects altered the use of the balance mechanisms at different cadences. The lateral ankle mechanism was used more in the Low condition, while the foot placement mechanism was used more in the High condition. There was no difference in the use of the push-off mechanism between cadence conditions. These results suggest that neural control of balance is altered when gait characteristics, such as cadence change, suggesting a flexible balance response that is sensitive to the constraints of the gait cycle. We speculate that the use of the balance mechanisms may be a factor resulting in well-known characteristics of gait in populations with …",

However, these perturbations are designed to provoke a specific context of instability that may or may not generalize to a broader understanding of falls risk. The purpose of this study was to determine if the effect of balance perturbations on instability generalizes across contexts. 29 younger adults and 28 older adults completed four experimental trials, including unperturbed walking and walking while responding to three perturbation contexts: mediolateral optical flow, treadmill-induced slips, and lateral waist-pulls. We quantified the effect of perturbations as an absolute change in margin of stability from unperturbed walking. We found significant changes in mediolateral and anteroposterior margin of stability for all perturbations compared to unperturbed walking in both cohorts (p-values ≤ 0.042). In older adults, the mediolateral effects of lateral waist …",

Non-linear measures, such as Jensen-Shannon Divergence and Lempel-Ziv Complexity, may help explain when and how stroke survivors move so that interventions to increase activity may be designed more effectively.Objectives: Our objective was to understand what factors affect a stroke survivor's physical activity, including weather, by characterizing activity by step counts, structure, and complexity.Methods: A custom MATLAB code was used to analyze clinical trial (NCT02835313, https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02835313) data presented as minute by minute step counts. Six days of data were analyzed for 142 participants to determine the regularity of activity structure across days and complexity patterns of varied cadences. The effect of steps on structure and complexity, the season's effect on steps, structure, and complexity, and the presence of precipitation's effect on steps and complexity were all analyzed.Results: Step counts and regularity were linearly related (p < 0.001). Steps and complexity were quadratically related (r2 = 0.70 for mean values, 0.64 for daily values). Season affected complexity between spring and winter (p = 0. 019). Season had no effect on steps or structure. Precipitation had no effect on steps or complexity.Conclusions: Stroke survivors with high step counts are active at similar times each day and have higher activity complexities as measured through patterns of movement at different intensity levels.

We quantified stabilizing responses as a change in margin of stability from unperturbed walking. Older adults generally exhibited larger instability than younger adults in response to walking balance perturbations. Only the Fear of Falls Questionnaire-Revised showed an increase in perceived falls risk for older adults. We found no significant correlations for older adults between any balance perturbation response and questionnaires of self-perception.

Young (18-35 years of age), middle-aged (55-64 years), and older (65 years and older) adults responded to anterior and posterior disturbances from surface translations.

As an exception, it was hypothesized that posterior, single-stepping thresholds would not be reduced with increasing age.

Young adults demonstrated larger anterior single-stepping thresholds than that of middle-aged and older adults. No influence of age on posterior single-stepping …",

We quantified local medial gastrocnemius (MG) and tibialis anterior (TA) neuromechanics using cine B-mode ultrasound and surface electromyography before, during, and after the perturbation. Our findings partially supported the hypothesis that anticipated perturbations would elicit greater proactive agonist muscle adjustments than unanticipated perturbations. Though, these adjustments were direction-dependent; MG showed greater activation in anticipation of accelerations while TA activation did not change in anticipation of decelerations.

      "abstract": "The Margin of Stability (MOS) is often assessed relative to the intended, linear path of walking progression. When an unanticipated or irregular change in direction occurs, such as during a sudden turn or during activities of daily living, distinguishing the lateral from anteroposterior MOS can be challenging. The purpose of this study was to assess an anatomically orientated method of calculating the MOS using the pelvic orientation to define lateral and anteroposterior directions. We hypothesized that when straight walking was disrupted with a curved path, the pelvis-oriented MOS measure would be less variable compared to the global-oriented MOS measure. We recruited 16 unimpaired participants to walk at preferred and fast walking speeds along a straight walking path, as well as a path with an exaggerated, curvilinear deviation. We determined the within-subject mean and standard deviation of the anterior MOS …",

Proof-of-concept demonstrations validated these calculated contributions by restricting CoP motion under one or both feet.

      "abstract": "Objective The purpose of this study was to demonstrate that the construct of falls efficacy, as measured by the Activities-Specific Balance Confidence (ABC) scale, is comprised of distinct factors in those with chronic stroke. Design This study is a cross-sectional analysis of pre-existing data from a research registry. Setting Academic institution. Participants 248 community-dwelling adults history of one or more strokes, verified by CT/MRI report or past provider. Interventions Not applicable. Main Outcome Measure(s): Goodness-of-Fit indices (Root Mean Square Error of Approximation (RMSEA), Comparative Fit Index (CFI), and Tucker-Lewis Fit Index (TLI)). Results To test our hypothesis that the ABC scale is comprised of distinct factors linked to the balance domains, we proposed that the ABC scale items are indicative of three subdomains, 1) anticipatory control, 2) walking balance, and 3) reactive balance. A confirmatory factor analysis was performed to test this hypothesized structure. We assigned ABC Q1,2,8,10-12 to walking balance, Q3-7,9 to anticipatory control, and Q13-16 to reactive balance. All indicators significantly loaded as hypothesized. Modification indices suggested that Q6, which asks about standing on a chair and reaching for something, might be multidimensional and load onto both the anticipatory control and reactive balance latent constructs. Therefore, confidence in reaching while on a stool reflects confidence in both anticipatory and reactive balance. Conclusion(s): These results suggest that the items in the ABC scale measure three subfactors that align with anticipatory control, walking balance, and reactive balance.",

      "abstract": "Biomechanically, falling after a walking perturbation may be influenced by: (1) the pre-perturbation state of mechanical stability (e.g., stability margins) and (2) the response to a perturbation (i.e., recovery skill). Walking stability margins must be modifiable to serve as a target for fall-prevention interventions. We investigated if neurotypical adults could proactively modulate pre-perturbation anteroposterior stability margins while walking. Eleven adults walked on a treadmill at three speeds with and without anterior and posterior perturbations. We measured stability margins anteriorly at mid-swing and posteriorly at foot strike for pre-perturbation steps. A repeated-measures factorial ANOVA evaluated main effects and interactions of walking speed (0.6, 0.8, 1.0 stats/s) and perturbation type (anterior, none, posterior). With posterior perturbation threats, the posterior stability margins were more positive at foot strike (p < 0.01 …",
